            <p class="job-description">
                Interviews were carried out to gather qualitative data on what general expectations a user would have for a professional portfolio. The interviews consisted of questions about the user’s professional background, what they would consider when building their own portfolio, and their input on how they would expect this porfolio to look like.

              This analysis consists of collecting a sample of competitors products and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each product to expand our insight. This product is a professional portfolio that targets the audience of recruiters and business clients. Each competitor in the sample was selected because they have the same purpose and target audience.

            <p class="job-description">
              This matrix identifies functions considered in the development of this portfolio and evaluating the priority of each function based on three criteria; the value it brings to the user, the value it brings to the business goals of the project, and the effort required to develop. Each feature listed in the feature value matrix was selected because it was mentioned as a desirable feature in the user interviews or if it was identified as a strength in the competitor analysis. The primary challenge of this was identifying an accurate rating for user value and business value of each feature using the limited information gathered from the interviews.

              From utilizing the quantified ratings of each feature in the feature value matrix, each feature can be placed on the Kano Model to visualize the results of the matrix. The features prioritized are those that offer high user value, high business value, and require low technical effort to implement. The highest priority features will be the first to be implemented in the interface design. The lower priority features will be implemented only if time and costs permit.

            <p class="job-description">
                User stories are developed to describe and narrow down the tasks that the user expects to accomplish when using website. Properly developed user stories help focus the design process on the goals of the user and prevent the addition of unnecessary features. These user stories were created based on the use cases that we collected from user interviews and the user value associated with each high priority feature.

            <p class="job-title">Cognitive Walkthrough</p>
            <p class="job-description">
              A sample of users were given the task of interacting with the interface of the website and a set of questions that accompanied this. This uncovers any usability issues and complaints about how the interface is currently designed. The primary challenge when conducting the cognitive walkthroughs came from the level of uncertainty in the user’s answers. Because of the simplicity of the website, most of the information collected revolved around vague comments about the site’s aesthetic appearance. These aesthetic comments are difficult to prioritize given the small sample size.

            <p class="job-description">
              There were two main tests conducted; a click test and a questions test. </br></br>
              The click test was selected to examine how users would navigate the site for information that is not clearly identified in the navigation bar. The results of the test revealed that users identified the profile picture as a potential button for navigation.

              </br></br>
              The questions test laid out a series of questions pertaining to the aesthetic appearing of the site. This test was selected to remediate the primary challenge identified in the cognitive walkthrough section. There was a problem with using usabilityhub for aesthetic questions where the screen-shot of the portfolio presented to testers had a lower font size that skewed the results of my test. The main finding that this test revealed was that a majority of the users did not like the monotony of color in the design.

      <!--5.INVOLVEMENTS-->
      <div class="involvements" id="involvements-section">
        <h2  class="section-title"><span>Summary of Findings</span></h2>
        <div class="involvements-content">
          <p>
            The first main insight gained from this user study was a better understanding of how much interactive interactive is appropriate for this portfolio. It was expressed that the portfolio looked too much like a basic resume that they scanned from top to bottom and that it did not properly utilize the play potential that website can offer. The users would be more interested and engaged in the content if they could do more than just scroll up and down the page. Although it became evident that more interactive elements needed to be added, the extent to which it should be added needed to be evaluated. The competitor analysis revealed that, unless the portfolio’s purpose was to be hired for a UX/UI design position, interactions resulting with complex visual stimulation was not required. In the portfolios of the competitors that were not UX/UI designers, interactive user navigation offered the most value to the user.
          </br></br>

            The second insight was that users felt that the design and content needed to be improved. Throughout the study, users expressed a concern with the monotony of the design and the disengaging nature of the content. There were a lot of suggestions for improving the color scheme of the web page. The colors currently chosen seem to give off a dull image in the user’s perspective. The form of the content on the portfolio is currently boring to consume. Users were also observed to only read the content that was in paragraph form and skipped over any content that was in bullet points. In some interviews, it was mentioned that the content needed to express more personality rather than just a list of qualifications. From observing the competitors sites, all information was delivered in paragraph and visual form. It is possible that content in narrative form will offer a better experience for the user.
          </br></br>

            The overarching challenge faced when conducting this user study was evaluating the significance of each data point collected from the user. The first issue was figuring out how to properly utilize the opinions of a few to design an interface for the masses. There needed to be careful evaluation of whether or not an answer in the interview would apply to other users or if it would be an individual preference. The second issue was trying to understand what the users really meant by their answers when they themselves were not clear about what they thought about their answer. The last issue in this challenge was using these data points to accurately evaluate the user value of each feature.

      <!--6.CONTACT-->
      <div class="contact" id="contact-section">
        <h2 class="section-title"><span>Incorporation of Findings</span></h2>
        <div class="contact-content">
            In order to create a more interactive interface, I plan create a navigation menu that is present at all times. This feature was chosen to be implemented into the design due to several reasons. Users had mentioned that they did not like the experience of using the basic scroll function to navigate the page. It was also observed that the majority of the competitors incorporated this feature into their portfolios and had success with their design. Lastly, this was a feature that was deemed as a higher priority feature from the feature value matrix.
          </br></br>

            	The aesthetic design and delivery of content will be improved three main changes. The first change will be to change the color scheme of the website. This is due to the fact that in two user interviews, the users mentioned that the currently color scheme is dull. The second change would be to reformat the content from bullet points to narrative paragraph form. This will help shift the experience of the site from reading a resume into reading a narrative. The last change will be adding more images and strategically re-organizing the placement of these images to improve the aesthetic look of the web page. If done correctly, it will not only improve the aesthetic look of the page but will also make it easier for users to differentiate one section of content from another. This will be done by using image placement techniques observed from competitor pages.

        </br></br>
            The main challenge to implementing these solutions will be designing the aesthetic appearance of these new features. As of now, the data collected is limited to pain points but does not yet offer any concrete solutions nor does it guarantee that the user will like the changes. There will be an issue with creating an interface that is pleasing to the end user without constant iteration of cognitive walkthroughs and user testing.
